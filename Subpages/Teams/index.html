                Our Drill team is more focused on the execution of drill commands correctly and accurately. Cadets spend
                hours
                practicing and perfecting a large range of drill commands.

                The Color Guard Team is the most active team within local events. You will most likely see them, in
                parades,
                city gatherings, graduation, football games, and many more important events. Within the color guard you
                will
                see our cadets marching with flags surrounded by rifles, hence the name color guard.

                The Rifle Team is one of our most intense and best teams. Not only do cadets have to learn how to
                operate an
                air rifle, they also have to remain consistent and disciplined through out thier journey as this team
                requires intense commiment and dedication. Cadets will devote multiple hours in physical and mental
                Training.
                If you are up to the challange then make sure to come prepared, Good luck.
