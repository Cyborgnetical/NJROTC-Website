          Led by retired Navy personnel 
          the Parlier High School Navy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps or <u>NJROTC</u> was established in 1995.
          Our goal is to mold our students into better citizens by <u>teaching them real-life skills</u> for a better future.
          Our NJROTC program helps cadets with leadership, management, responsibility, discipline, physical training, and confidence,
          Exposing them to real-world situations. Cadets begin learning self-discipline with basic drills such as the position of attention, parade rest, and marching.

          Cadets have many opportunities to be involved through our Academic, Air Rifle, Color Guard, and Drill Teams. 
          Cadets also have an opportunity to be part of the Unit Staff and are able to be promoted in rank by completing the advanced requirements.
