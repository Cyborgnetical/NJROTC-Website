            The NJROTC program helps Cadets with leadership, management, responsibility, discipline, physical training, confidence, and exposes them to real world circumstances. 
            This program is open to both male and female students.  
            Cadets begin learning self-discipline with basic drill such as position of attention, parade rest and marching. 
            Cadets have many opportunities to be involved through teams such as our Academic, Air Rifle, Color Guard, and Drill Teams. 
            Cadets also have an opportunity to be part of the Unit Staff and are able to promote in rank by completing the advance requirements.   
            Our Unit is active in our local community through various activities to include parades, service projects and providing held during many of our community's activities.  
            We strive to make both our campus and our community a better place.
